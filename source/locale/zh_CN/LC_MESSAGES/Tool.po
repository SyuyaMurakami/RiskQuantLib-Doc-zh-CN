"**Notice: RiskQuantLib is not designed to provide with detail functions, "
"such as connecting to database or dealing with string. It is designed as "
"an scaffold, like a box where you put all your familiar tools into it. "
"RiskQuantLib will package those tools into a template, and make it "
"convient to use next time. So here, all these kinds of tools are more "
"examples than tools, it help users to understand how RiskQuantLib "
"organize a project.**"
